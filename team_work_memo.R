We are team 16, with team members Dominik Kuczkowski, Karl Zhu and Rong Guang.

We held our first team meeting on 19 November, when we discussed and made 
decisions on the schedule for the final task. 

# Key points

The key points include:
  
  - Task stages and expected duration for each stage.
  
  - The way we collaborate (whoâ€™s in charge of which stage and how others make 
    contribution)
  
  - Tools, platforms, and information sources.
  
  - Weekly meeting schedule.

# Details for task stages and duty allocation
  
  - We decided to separate the tasks into three parts (stages) and each team 
    member is responsible for one part : 
  
       - Rong Guang in charge of stage 1 wrangling

       - Dominik Kuczkowski in charge of modeling

       - Karl Zhu in charge of reporting
       
  - Each team member is responsible for one part, with others contributing to 
    the process. 
    
      -In each stage, the duty for the responsible peroson is 
       
         - to initialize the corresponding part of task
    
         - to push the progression of the part of task
    
         - to inform other team members about the progression of the task
    
         - if the task involving coding, make sure the codes are explicitly 
           commented and timely pushed to repo.  
    
         - to timely bring onto table the key decison points he runs into and 
           decide with the contribution and/or agreement of all members
           
         - to respond to the enquiry, contribution and concern other team 
           members with respective to this specific part of taskCallbackManager
           
         - to make adjustment of the code/text, during or after corresponding
           stage, according to any legitimate need (e.g. needs from the finding 
           in next stages). 
           
         - At the end of each stage, the responsible persons should summarise 
           their work, either verbally or textually, to the others.

   - We will use R as major tool, but also open to using Python in necessary 
     circumstances. 
     
   - We will use GitHub Repo for code sharing and collaborating.
     
   - We will choose a platform supporting latex and collaboration for drafting
     final report
